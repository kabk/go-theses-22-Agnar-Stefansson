					<p>
						After developing a knitting pattern program which generates patterns in 2021 I have wanted to
						know if my patterns would ever reach the same cultural appreciation similar to the classic
						knitting patterns of the past like the eight-leafed rose known as the ‘Selburose’. This ancient
						form can be found in a stamp-seal created in the Mesopotamia around 2000BC - 1000BC. But is the
						value of the rose found in its history and could a computer generated rose reach similar
						cultural validation?
						By looking at the Selburose’s blurry historical significance and the evolving relationship
						between humans and machines through knitting, I am able to weave the history of knitting with
						its transformation towards industrialisation, the consequential ‘Arts and crafts movement’
						revolt against the machine which shaped the current view people have of artworks created by a
						computer today. In the process I unveil the common approach to knitting and programming as well
						as merge the art of code with the tradition of encoding stories into patterns and diving deep
						into their visual similarities.
						The book ‘Sense of order: A study in psychology of decorative art’ has been my primary source
						for historical references of ornamental art and the book “Form + Code: In Design, Art and
						Architecture” has shed a light on the history of code and computers and its use in the creative
						field. The artwork of Phillip Stearns called “Fragmented Memory” (2013) has been a great case
						study for my arguments where the many disciplines of code, computer, machine, textile and art
						are merged into one. Throughout my research I’ve been using historical- and exploratory research
						and qualitative methods.
						After discovering that the meaning behind the Selburose is mostly lost through time and other
						meanings have been adopted throughout history, it gave me space to reinvent how we put meaning
						into patterns. It is unfair to pin a computer generated ‘selburose’ against its handmade
						counterpart. Viewing them as separate entities it is easier to appreciate each rose on their
						own. The semiotic meaning of the selburose and its survival through the decades and the
						computer-generated one for its hidden meaning and human innovation in technology and computers,
						making code a contemporary tool to aid in art and design.

					<h2 class="subtitle" id="intro">Intro</h2>
					<p>As you read this text, and depending on the season there is a high chance you might be wearing a
						knitted garment, or at least you own one. The garment stored in your closet was most likely made
						by a mechanical knitting machine, knitting rows and rows of yarn in minutes. Some are lucky to
						have handmade garments, painstakingly knitted by hand one knit at a time. Whether they were
						knitted by a human or a machine they both follow the same logic. ‘One plain and one purl’ is the
						most common knitting pattern there is. It could also be only knitted in two colours. This binary
						way of thinking is most often associated with the computer where bits are organised into 1 or 0,
						‘On’ or ‘Off’. With this common language of knitting, textiles and coding it is possible to
						explore the different ways we perceive artworks made through these different mediums, both on
						their own but also together. </p>
					<p>In what way are traditional knitting patterns better than computer-generated ones? Are
						traditional knitting patterns better than computer-generated ones?</p>
					<p>After seeing the selburose - a common knitting pattern - it is easy to translate the black and
						white boxes into pixels. By using the common binary language of knitting and coding, what can
						this ancient knitting pattern tell us about the way we see computer-generated art today? </p>
					<p>Throughout history, knitting has changed importance, from being the only way farmers had warm
						clothes without having to kill their life stock for their wool and skin. Knitting has become a
						pass-time just as coding is becoming a pass time. Both need a considerate amount of
						concentration, patients and craftsmanship. At the intersection of these two hobbies lies an
						interesting observation that is often overlooked but has been utilised by a certain number of
						artists.</p>

							Knitting has been a part of every major culture.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
							The oldest examples of knits have been found in Egypt dated to the 12th century.<sup><a
									href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> It is suggested that the craft travelled through
							North-Africa to Spain and the rest of Europe. Knitting reached Iceland’s shores around the
							16th century which is indicated by the oldest preserved items found in the National Museum
							of Iceland. It has also been a strong part of their national identity since then. With its
							ability to come together, care for each other, clothe and tell stories and history with and
							through the knits. Everybody on the farm would participate in the knitting process. From
							shearing the wool, spinning it into thread and knitting it into garments.<sup><a href="#fn3"
									id="ref3">3</a></sup>
							In those days wool was sheared of sheeps during late- summer early autumn and was spun into
							yarn later in the winter when farmers and workers spent most of their time indoors.

							The industrialisation of knitting devastated the hand knitters by making garments cheaper
							and faster. It became a turning point for knitting in which it changed from a profession to
							a hobby.
							The reason industrialization was so devastating for kitting was the invention of the Jaquard
							loom and other similar mechanical productions of knitted goods. The loom was invented by
							Joseph-Marie Jacquard, a french merchant and weaver. With his loom it was possible for
							unskilled workers to weave complex patterns in a matter of minutes which took skilled
							workers to do manually much longer. This affected the method and prices of garments making
							them cheaper in the process. Making expensive sought after patterns aquireable by lower
							classes. The groundbreaking element of the loom were its punch cards which made it possible
							to switch between raising and lowering the warp much quicker than before. This technology
							was referenced in the book <em>“Sketch of The Analytical Engine Invented by Charles
								Babbage”</em> where Ada Lovelace a british mathematician compares Babbage’s engine to
							the Jaquard’s loom

								The Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns, just as the Jacquard loom weaves

							</p>
						</div>
						<p>
							She makes the observation due to both machines using punching cards. However, in Babbage’s
							case, he uses them not as input for patterns but for numbers. Even though the Analytical
							Engine never became fully realised the same principles were used in today's computers. Using
							binary language to calculate complex problems.

								Babbage”</em> where Ada Lovelace a british mathematician compares Babbage’s engine to
							the Jaquard’s loom
							Despite the innovation of the knitting machine, people still knitted by hand, even today.
							The machine managed to turn this once powerful asset into a pass-time and hobby. Knitting is
							a calming repetitive job made easy with a set of instructions. These instructions go row by
							row, explaining which knit needs to be knitted or in which colour. Most often it is
							<em>“plain”</em> and a <em>“purl”</em> which are represented with the letters “K” for plain
							knit and “P” for purl knit. When knitting with colours often the primary colour will be
							mentioned as “MC” as in ‘Main Colour’ and the secondary colour as “CC” or “Contrast-
							Colour”. These pieces of information are often depicted in rows as rounds on paper. Like
							this scarf pattern:
						</p>

						<p>
							Round 1: *With Main Color (MC), k1; with CC, k7, repeat from * to end of round.<br>
							Round 2: With CC, knit to end of round.<br>
							Round 3: *With CC, k4; with MC, k1; with CC, k7; with MC, k1; with CC, k3, repeat from * to
							end of round.<br>
							*note the number after the “k” indicates the number of knits that need to be performed. <br>
						</p>

						<p>
							This can be correlated to the word algorithm in the context of computers, which is usually a
							set of instructions that a computer needs to follow. This practice is not too far off from a
							simple knitting pattern. When writing a program the computer must follow a set of
							instructions line by line to complete it.

									The set of instructions to knit and code are not the only thing they have in common.
									There are countless knitting magazines that have been produced in Iceland and when
									looking at an illustration of a knitting pattern they are usually depicted on a grid
									sheet of paper with each square filled either black or white depending on where MC
									or CC should go. As seen in fig X depicts a mitten pattern found in the knitting
									magazine “Hugur og Hönd” with a common knitting pattern called the Selburose. This
									binary depiction of the pattern can easily be interpreted as pixels on a screen made
									by a coded program.
								</p>
								<p>
									The use of code in art can be put into two categories - none of which is lesser than
									the other. They are production and conception. Back in the 19th-century production
									was the main focus of machines but as they evolved into home computers their skills
									broadened towards conception, or forming an idea. This view was best captured by the
									words of A. Micheal Noll “an intellectual and active creative partner that when
									fully exploited could be used to produce wholly new art forms and possibly new
									aesthetic experiences”. He compares the computer to a partner in which new
									territories in the art can be explored, broadening our forms of expression through
									art.

							<div class="textinpar">
								<p>
									Because of the computers inherent capability of being able to perform the same
									calculations over and over again displaying the output in a binary - pixel like
									output imitating a knitting pattern. By creating a program that generates knitting
									patterns based on an l-system - , recursion and mirroring pixels it is possible to
									generate countless variations. It is important to be clear here. In reality the
									program’s output is actually a motif which is the fundamental building block of a
									pattern, without a motif, there is no pattern. It is not until you repeat that motif
									multiple times when a pattern emerges. With every pattern there needs to be an input
									in binary, or 1 and 0. This input can be random however it can also be based on any
									character encoding that uses binary input, for example like the ASCII binary
									alphabet. That type of code can be described as transcoding. Where one type of
									digital material is converted into another.
								</p>

								<p>
									With this new found way of transcoding information into a motif it is curious to
									compare a well known knitting pattern with its computer generated counterpart. When
									the input is “Selburose” the output is not the selburose people have learned to knit
									and love for centuries but the program’s interpretation or representation of the
									word. The “eight leaf-rose”- which it is also known as - gets its name from the town
									of Selbu located in Norway where in 1851 a young girl named Marit Guldsetbrua Emstad
									knitted a pair of mittens for her church and on the back palm had the rose decorated
									in black and white. This pattern became an instant hit among the townsfolk and it is
									said to have gained popularity in knitting around the world thanks to Selbu - and
									Norway's - export of knitted goods. This story is most often associated with the
									selburose’s rise to fame however it is not the pattern's origin. It is depicted in
									the book “Sjónabókin - Icelandic Patterns and Ornaments” which holds patterns and
									ornaments found in Iceland since the 16th century including the Selburose, which
									predates the one made in 1851. The earliest example of this geometric octagram is in
									the archive of the British Museum; there are many instances of the Selburose in
									different variations, cultures, context and material, however, the oldest example
									found was dated 2000 BC - 1000 BC and can be found on a stamp seal from the
									Mesompotamian era. Stamp seals were usually made to leave an impression on wet clay
									for storytelling purposes and the rose is depicted in a landscape setting most
									possibly representing a star rather than a rose. A more recognisable and geometric
									form of the Selburose can be found on a sheath found in Britain during the Roman
									Empire rule in mid 1st century BC. In that instance it is easy to presume that it is
									as well trying to depict a star rather than a rose. The sheath has two circular
									decorations above and below it and the description mentions a <span
										style="font: var(--font-size-head) var(--font-family);  font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;font-size: var(--font-size-body);">“crescent
										moon”</span> on the upper panel. Strengthening the belief that it represents a
									star.
								</p>
							</div>



						</div>

						<p>
							Despite the rose’s lack of cultural and historical meaning it is still knitted today with
							many people connecting it with Christmas, winter or even the country of Norway.
						</p>

						<p>
							Following the red thread of the history of the Selburose there is no clear or true origin to
							this form which could be for its simple shape, geometric element and variety. It has
							survived through the decades and can be found on sweaters, socks, hat and scarfs everywhere
							despite lacking any cultural meaning. Going back to the computer-generated selburose could
							the same thing accur? Is there a difference between computer-generated patterns and ones
							made by humans?
						</p>

						<p>
							When knitting with two colours it is easy to make repetitive patterns. These first patterns
							made by humans are mostly based on their surroundings and object which were beautiful for
							them, so there is no wonder why most patterns, ornaments and motifs are based on nature,
							plants, flowers and even stars. Perhaps it is because of nature’s inherent beauty and
							ever-changing seasons. However, rarely is nature as structured as most knitting patterns, so
							some human intervention for rule and order is implemented.
						</p>

						<p>
							When the selburose is put alongside the computer-generated selburose there is a stark
							difference in appearance. One was drawn for many centuries changing little over time and the
							other was generated from 1s and 0s in milliseconds. Which one is more valuable?
						</p>

						<p>
							When something is made by the computer there is almost an urge to mention it in advance. As
							if there is something to excuse when it has gone through the digital process. Like it is
							somehow lesser than what the human hand can reproduce.
						</p>

						<p>
							Why is that?

								“Form which is not taken from natural objects are ugly”,
							</p>
						</div>
						<p>
							These are the words written by the English writer John Ruskin. Born in 1819 he was
							associated with the arts and crafts movement. The movement focused on reforming design and
							decoration as a counter-movement towards rapid industrialisation. William Morris - another
							follower of the movement - continues in his text to argue the increased profit greed and
							less attention to detail will result in the overall quality of a work being diminished. This
							was also expanded by William Morris in his paper “Hope and Fears of Art” saying
							“...everything made by man’s hands has a form, which must be either beautiful or ugly;
							beautiful if it is in accord with Nature, and helps her; ugly if it is discordant with
							Nature, and thwarts her; it cannot be indifferent…” It is hard to argue that the machine is
							in fact natural due to its many mystical properties and Morris’ words seem to suggest that
							the machine and therefore computers will never make beautiful art because of their lack of
							connection towards nature.

						</p>

						<p>
							The industrial revolution had the beneficial effect that clothes, furniture and other status
							symbols became ever more acquirable for the lower- and middle-class citizens. These new
							productions however lacked in quality, so much so that Alexis de Tocquville wrote in 1812
							about the effect of workmanship made by Percier and Fontaine “a look of brilliance
							unannounced to its true worth” “appear as something he is not” which sheds a light that
							machine-made decorations are inherently ugly.

						</p>

						<p>
							However, that does not diminish the machine's potential. As Frank Lloyd Wright, mostly known
							as an architect, indicates in his essay from 1901. He mostly criticised Morris for his
							narrow view on machines and tries to highlight its benefits for human labour, innovation and
							the future. Using the printer as an example, which in many ways is a machine, calling it the
							first great machine after a great city. The machine, Wright writes, is a “tool which frees
							human labour, lengthens and broadens the life of the simplest man.” By that, he means that
							the machine should be looked at as a tool to aid persons in their projects. He goes on
							saying that in every age there have been tools which humans have used freely to express
							themselves in art “…the tool most successful in saving the most precious thing in the world
							- human effort”. This can be compared to today’s use of computers, where we have found ways
							to simplify otherwise complex and repetitive tasks, saving both time and energy with the
							added benefit of making it more accessible for a greater number of people.

									This view of the machine still echoes until this day. With the development of tools
									such as artificial intelligence, some computer scientists have made a program that
									generates paintings based on various styles found in museums around the world, for
									example landscapes, portraits and still life. Alumni at the The Art & AI Laboratory
									in Rutgers University are behind the developments. Their conclusion was “The system
									was evaluated by human subject experiments which showed that human subjects
									regularly confused the generated art with the human art, and sometimes rated the
									generated art higher on various high-level scales.” However they did note that “…it
									[the computer] does not have any semantic understanding of art behind the concept of
									styles.” Leaving all the art open for interpretation by the humans observing it.
									Without semantics it is hard to have a meaningful discussion about art. When
									observing the portrait section of the generated art there is an eerie feel to it,
									almost uncanny they look almost as half melted ghost screaming for their lives,

									In his work “Bio-Morphosis” ,artist Stanislas Chaillou generated countless
									illustrations of plants and flowers through AI, saying it “cuts across species and
									usual classifications by transposing biomorphism into the poetic field.” Training
									the AI to see countless illustrations made by Karl Bossfeld published in his book
									“Urformen der Kunst” from 1928. The result are flowers never before seen by the
									human eye, something that nature could never produce. By not knowing the fundamental
									law of nature the AI is in position to break free from convention and create
									something completely original. However none of these are roses. Only the computer's
									interpretation of what data they were fed.

									There is however financial interest in art made by computers as demonstrated by the
									collective named Obvious. The artwork named “Portrait of Edmond Belamy” generative
									Adversarial Network print, on canvas. Which sold for $432,500 but its estimated
									price was only $7,000 - $10,000

									However, making art with the machine or computers which does not try to emulate
									nature but create new perspectives is perfectly illustrated in the artwork
									Fragmented Memory (2013) by <a href="https://phillipstearns.com/"> Phillip David
										Stearns</a>. This triptych woven artworks made from Stearns computer’s physical
									memory and woven at the TextileMuseum Tilburg memorialise his computer’s data in
									fabric. It divides the data into 6 bits which is then assigned a RGB colour value -
									transcoding the data into colours. On the back there is the key to the encryption
									which in theory would make it possible to decode the information presented on the
									front of the fabric.

									“Textiles have long been used as a medium for imagery but are also closely connected

									collapses these two histories, functioning as a visual and physical medium for the

							<a href="https://www.newrafael.com/">Rafaël Rozendaal</a> is a Dutch-Brazilian visual artist
							currently working in New York. In his work “Abstract Browsing” Rozendaal explores the
							abstraction of a common computer-browser by using a plug-in. When activated the browser
							becomes a random collection of colourful rectangles. “It shows you the skeleton of the web.
							It’s like seeing an X-ray of a building, showing the structural elements.” Since computers,
							phones and other electronics have become such an integrated part of our lives there is full
							reason to speculate how to preserve all this information. The obvious solution is to copy
							everything and store it in a safe place but it’s quite unpredictable how long this data will
							last.

									By allowing the computer to determine the outcome of the piece with a common
									language and medium that both computers and humans could understand, Stearns manages
									to bridge the gap between humans and machines. This steers away from the shallow
									re-creations of the CAN program. This way of looking at computers and arts could be
									compared with the “truth of material” a principle by Redgraves which believes that
									the innate qualities of the materials should influence the projects created from
									them. By allowing the computer to produce the art it wants we can start to see it
									from a conceptual art point of view. In conceptual art, the idea or concept coupled
									with the artwork is seen as the most important aspect of the artwork

								</p>

								<p>
									“When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means that all of the planning and
									decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea
									becomes a machine that makes the art.”

								</p>

								<p>
									In his text “Art after Philosophy” Joseph Kosuth writes about aesthetics “it’s
									important to separate aesthetics from art because aesthetics deals with opinions and
									perceptions of the world in general”. He goes on to say that ornament’s main reason
									to be is purely for aesthetic purposes, to make something look more attractive than
									it is. Formalist criticism on art is only based on its physical attributes and
									bypasses its conceptual element. “formalist art becomes art only by virtue of its
									resemblance to earlier works of art ”. The artisans of the old used aesthetics as a
									crutch to sell their art

						<h2 class="subtitle" id="chapter-4">IV<br> “A rose is a rose is a rose”</h2>

						<p>
							By approaching computer-generated art from a conceptual viewpoint it is possible to
							experience the art in a new light. Revisiting the computer-generated pattern of the word
							“selburose” the arrangement of pixels stops being just random but a new chapter of the rose
							life. Stripping away the cultural heritage, the empty meaning behind the original rose,
							stripping the aesthetics formalist meaningless purpose of art the computer-generated pattern
							become something else.

						</p>
						<p>
							When looking at the computer-generated rose and the original selburose as equals it is easy
							to appreciate the original rose more. It is something familiar, something seen for thousands
							of years, and before that its shape was seen in nature itself. Humans are conditioned to
							like the things which seem familiar to them, and therefore dislike what seems unfamiliar.
							But when looking at the roses, not as different faces on the same coin but two different
							coins from two different currencies it’s easier to appreciate each one on their own, and for
							what they hold. The selburose has its culture, aesthetics and its beauty and comfort can be
							found from its familiarity and history and its endless appreciation from countless cultures.
							The computer-generated selburose can be appreciated by its conceptual elements. The
							fasciation of human innovation in machinery, the almost mythical properties of the computer.
							The common language of knitting and code.
